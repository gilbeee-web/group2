        Lift your head, baby, don't be scared<br>
        Of the things that could go wrong along the way<br>
        You'll get by with a smile<br>
        You can't win at everything, but you can try<br><br>

        Baby, you don't have to worry<br>
        'Cause there ain't no need to hurry<br>
        No one ever said that there's an easy way<br>
        When they're closing all their doors<br>
        And they don't want you anymore<br>
        This sounds funny, but I'll say it anyway<br><br>

        Girl, I'll stay through the bad times<br>
        Even if I have to fetch you everyday<br>
        We'll get by with a smile<br>
        You can never be too happy in this life<br><br>

        'Cause in a world where everybody hates a happy ending story<br>
        It's a wonder love can make the world go round<br>
        But dont let it bring you down<br>
        And turn your face into a frown<br>
        You'll get along with a little prayer and a song<br><br>

        Let me hear you sing it<br><br>

        Now it's time to kiss away those tears goodbye<br>
        Let me hear you sing it<br>
