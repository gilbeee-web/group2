        Honey, why you calling me so late?<br>
        It's kinda hard to talk right now<br>
        Honey, why you crying, is everything okay?<br>
        I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud<br><br>

        Well, my girl's in the next room<br>
        Sometimes I wish she was you<br>
        I guess we never really moved on<br>
        It's really good to hear your voice saying my name<br>
        It sounds so sweet<br>
        Coming from the lips of an angel<br>
        Hearing those words, it makes me weak<br>
        And I never wanna say goodbye<br>
        But, girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br><br>

        It's funny that you're calling me tonight<br>
        And, yes, I've dreamt of you too<br>
        And does he know you're talking to me?<br>
        Will it start a fight?<br>
        No, I don't think she has a clue<br><br>

        Well, my girl's in the next room<br>
        Sometimes I wish she was you<br>
        I guess we never really moved on<br>
        It's really good to hear your voice saying my name<br>
        It sounds so sweet<br>
        Coming from the lips of an angel<br><br>

        Hearing those words, it makes me weak<br>
        And I never wanna say goodbye<br>
        But, girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br>
        It's really good to hear your voice saying my name<br>
        It sounds so sweet<br>
        Coming from the lips of an angel<br><br>

        Hearing those words, it makes me weak<br>
        And I never wanna say goodbye<br>
        But, girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br>
        And I never wanna say goodbye<br>
        But, girl, you make it hard to be faithful<br>
        With the lips of an angel<br><br>
        Honey, why you calling me so late?
