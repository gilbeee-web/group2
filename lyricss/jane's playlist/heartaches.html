    <p>
        I recall when you said that you would never leave me<br>
        You told me more<br>
        So much more, like when the time you whispered in my ear<br>
        There was heaven in my heart<br>
        I remember when you said that you'd be here forever<br><br>

        Then you left without even saying that you're leaving<br>
        I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday<br>
        And I pray that you would stay<br>
        But then you're gone and, oh, so far away<br><br>

        I was afraid this time would come<br>
        I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurting from within<br>
        I have learned to live my life beside you<br>
        Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight<br>
        And if into my dream you come and touch me once again<br>
        I'll just keep on dreaming<br>
        'Til my heartaches end<br><br>

        And then you left without even saying that you're leaving<br>
        I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday<br>
        And I pray that you would stay<br>
        But then you're gone and, oh, so far away<br>
        I was afraid this time would come<br>
        I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurting from within<br>
        I have learned to live my life beside you<br>
        Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight<br>
        And if into my dream you come and touch me once again<br>
        I'll just keep on dreaming<br>
        'Til my heartaches end<br><br>

        Whoa, oh<br>
        Oh, yeah<br><br>

        I was afraid this time would come<br>
        I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurting from within<br>
        I have learned to live my life beside you<br>
        Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight<br>
        And if into my dream you come and touch me once again<br>
        I'll just keep on dreaming<br>
        'Til my heartaches end<br><br>
        Keep on dreaming<br>
        'Til my heartaches end<br>
