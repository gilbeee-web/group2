    <p>
        Take me as you are<br>
        Push me off the road<br>
        The sadness<br>
        I need this time to be with you<br>
        I'm freezing in the sun<br>
        I'm burning in the rain<br>
        The silence<br>
        I'm screaming, calling out your name<br><br>

        And I do reside in your light<br>
        Put out the fire with me and find<br>
        Yeah, you'll lose the side of your circles<br>
        That's what I'll do if we say goodbye<br><br>

        To be is all I gotta be<br>
        And all that I see<br>
        And all that I need this time<br>
        To me the life you gave me<br>
        The day you said goodnight<br><br>

        The calmness in your face<br>
        That I see through the night<br>
        The warmth of your light is pressing unto us<br>
        You didn't ask me why<br>
        I never would have known<br>
        Oblivion is falling down<br><br>

        And I do reside in your light<br>
        Put out the fire with me and find<br>
        Yeah, you'll lose the side of your circles<br>
        That's what I'll do if we say goodbye<br>
        To be is all I gotta be<br>
        And all that I see<br>
        And all that I need this time<br>
        To me the life you gave me<br>
        The day you said goodnight<br>
        If you could only know me like your prayers at night<br>
        Then everything between you and me will be alright<br><br>

        To be is all I gotta be<br>
        And all that I see<br>
        And all that I need this time<br>
        To me the life you gave me<br>
        The day you said goodnight<br><br>

        She's already taken<br>
        She's already taken<br>
        She's already taken me<br>
        She's already taken<br>
        She's already taken me<br><br>
        
        The day you said goodnight<br>
