    <p>
        I walked across an empty land<br>
        I knew the pathway like the back of my hand<br>
        I felt the earth beneath my feet<br>
        Sat by the river and it made me complete<br><br>

        Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?<br>
        I'm gettin' old, and I need something to rely on<br>
        So, tell me when you're gonna let me in<br>
        I'm gettin' tired, and I need somewhere to begin<br><br>

        I came across a fallen tree<br>
        I felt the branches of it looking at me<br>
        Is this the place we used to love?<br>
        Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?<br>
        Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?<br>
        I'm gettin' old, and I need something to rely on<br>
        So, tell me when you're gonna let me in<br>
        I'm gettin' tired, and I need somewhere to begin<br><br>

        And if you have a minute, why don't we go<br>
        Talk about it somewhere only we know?<br>
        This could be the end of everything<br>
        So, why don't we go<br><br>

        Somewhere only we know?<br>
        Somewhere only we know<br><br>

        Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?<br>
        I'm getting old, and I need something to rely on<br>
        So, tell me when you're gonna let me in<br>
        I'm getting tired, and I need somewhere to begin<br><br>

        And if you have a minute, why don't we go<br>
        Talk about it somewhere only we know?<br>
        This could be the end of everything<br>
        So, why don't we go?<br>
        So, why don't we go?<br>
        Ooh, hey, hey<br>
        Oh-oh-oh<br>
        This could be the end of everything<br>
        So, why don't we go somewhere only we know?<br>
        Somewhere only we know<br>
        Somewhere only we know<br>
