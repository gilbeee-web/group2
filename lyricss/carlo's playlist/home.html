    <p>
        I'm staring out into the night<br>
        Tryin' to hide the pain<br>
        I'm going to the place where love<br>
        And feeling good don't ever cost a thing<br>
        And the pain you feel's a different kind of pain<br><br>

        Well, I'm going home<br>
        Back to the place where I belong<br>
        And where your love has always been enough for me<br>
        I'm not running from<br>
        No, I think you got me all wrong<br>
        I don't regret this life I chose for me<br>
        But these places and these faces are getting old<br><br>
        
        So I'm going home<br>
        Well, I'm going home<br>
        The miles are getting longer, it seems<br>
        The closer I get to you<br>
        I've not always been the best man or friend for you<br>
        But your love remains true, and I don't know why<br>
        You always seem to give me another try<br>
        So I'm going home<br>
        Back to the place where I belong<br>
        And where your love has always been enough for me<br>
        I'm not running from<br>
        No, I think you got me all wrong<br>
        I don't regret this life I chose for me<br>
        But these places and these faces are getting old<br>
        Be careful what you wish for<br>
        'Cause you just might get it all<br>
        You just might get it all<br>
        And then some you don't want<br><br>

        Be careful what you wish for<br>
        'Cause you just might get it all<br>
        You just might get it all, yeah<br><br>

        Well, I'm going home<br>
        Back to the place where I belong<br>
        And where your love has always been enough for me<br>
        I'm not running from<br>
        No, I think you got me all wrong<br>
        I don't regret this life I chose for me<br>
        But these places and these faces are getting old<br>
        I said these places and these faces are getting old<br>
        So I'm going home<br>
        I'm going home<br>
