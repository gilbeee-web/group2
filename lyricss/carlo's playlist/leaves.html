    <p>
        I can think of all the times<br>
        You told me not to touch the light<br>
        I never thought that you would be the one<br>
        I couldn't really justify<br>
        How you even thought it could be right<br>
        Cause everything we cherished is gone<br>
        And in the end, can you tell me if<br>
        It was worth the try, so I can decide<br><br>

        Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees<br>
        And all will be alright in time<br>
        From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas<br>
        And all will be alright in time<br>
        Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive<br><br>

        Try as hard as I might<br>
        To flee the shadows of the night<br>
        It haunts me and it makes me feel blue<br>
        But how can I try to hide<br>
        When every breath and every hour<br>
        I still end up thinking of you?<br>
        And in the end, everything we have makes it worth the fight<br>
        So I will hold on for as long<br><br>

        As leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees<br>
        And all will be alright in time<br>
        From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas<br>
        And all will be alright in time<br>
        Oh you never really love someone until you learn to forgive<br><br>

        I never thought that I would see the day<br>
        That I'd decide if I should leave or stay<br>
        But in the end what makes it worth the fights<br>
        That no matter what happens we try to make it right<br><br>

        Leaves will soon grow from the bareness of trees<br>
        And all will be alright in time<br>
        From waves overgrown come the calmest of seas<br>
        And all will be alright in time<br>
        Wounds of the past will eventually heal<br>
        And all will be alright in time<br>
        'Cause all of this comes with a love that is real<br>
        I said all will be alright in time<br>
        I said all will be alright in time<br>
        I said all will be alright in time<br>
        All will be alright in time<br>
        Oh, you never really love someone until<br>
        You learn to forgive<br>
        You learn to forgive<br>
        Learn to forgive<br>
    </p>
