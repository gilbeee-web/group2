    <p>
        I don't really give a damn about the way you touch me<br>
        When we're alone<br>
        You can hold my hand<br>
        If no one's home<br>
        Do you like it when I'm away?<br>
        If I went and hurt my body, baby<br>
        Would you love me the same?<br>
        I can feel all my bones coming back<br>
        And I'm craving motion<br>
        Mama never really learns how to live by herself<br>
        It's a curse<br>
        And it's growing<br>
        You're a pond and I'm an ocean<br>
        Oh, all my emotions<br>
        Feel like explosions when you are around<br>
        And I've found a way to kill the sounds, oh<br><br>

        Oh, baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
        I need you here to stay<br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
        Crying at the lake<br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden?<br>
        Oh, and if I could take it all back<br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br><br>

        Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        I said no (I said no), I said no (I said no)<br>
        Listen close, it's a no<br>
        The wind is a-pounding on my back<br>
        And I found hope in a heart attack<br>
        Oh at last, it is past<br>
        Now I've got it, and you can't have it<br><br>

        Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
        I need you here to stay<br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
        Crying at the lake<br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh<br>
        And if I could take it all back<br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br><br>

        Darling, when I'm fast asleep<br>
        I've seen this person watching me<br>
        Saying, "Is it worth it? Is it worth it? Tell me, is it worth it?" Oh<br>
        Guess there is something, and there is nothing<br>
        There is nothing in between<br>
        And in my eyes, there is a tiny dancer<br>
        Watching over me, he's singing<br>
        "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a boy"<br>
        He's singing, "She's a, she's a lady, and I am just a line without a hook"<br><br>

        Baby, I am a wreck when I'm without you<br>
        I need you here to stay<br>
        I broke all my bones that day I found you<br>
        Crying at the lake<br>
        Was it something I said to make you feel like you're a burden, oh<br>
        And if I could take it all back<br>
        I swear that I would pull you from the tide<br>
