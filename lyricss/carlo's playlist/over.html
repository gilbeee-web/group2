    <p>
        I can't get over you<br>
        Even after all you put me through<br>
        I can't get enough of you<br>
        What am I supposed to do<br><br>

        I fell asleep in the back of the hotel floor<br>
        I can't take it anymore<br>
        Please leave a message at the door<br>
        I opened up where did it get me<br>
        On the floor of room 103<br>
        I wish I could escape and be free<br><br>

        I'm so over you<br>
        Through everything you put me through<br>
        My friends say I should get over you<br>
        But it's so hard to do<br>
        I really wanna see you cry<br>
        Does that make me a bad guy<br>
        You said that I wasn't enough for you<br><br>

        You know that is so untrue<br>
        What do I even mean to you<br>
        I saw you with the other guy at the party<br>
        Both of you were drinking way plenty<br>
        And getting too friendly<br>
        I'm so over you<br>
        Through everything you put me through<br>
        My friends say I should get over you<br>
        But it's so hard to do<br>
        I really wanna see you cry<br>
        Does that make me a bad guy<br><br>
