    <p>
        Hello<br>
        Are you awake right now?<br>
        God, I just need to hear the sound of you<br>
        Please, calm me down<br>
        And I know that it's selfish, but<br>
        You are the only thing that's<br>
        Ever made sense to me, I<br>
        I don't wanna do this<br>
        I don't know how to do this without you<br>
        <br>
        Cling to your side<br>
        Voices at night<br>
        Cover my eyes<br>
        I'm terrified<br>
        No in between<br>
        A face on a screen<br>
        Ain't an adequate replacement for your being with me<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>

        Too much time in the limelight<br>
        Gimme your all on the land line<br>
        Want it so bad but I won't lie<br>
        And it just gets worse in the night time<br>

        Never stays for long<br>
        And she's gone in the morning<br>
        <br>
        When you come home<br>
        I just got over being less of you<br>
        When you leave me<br>
        I'm in pieces<br>
        Maybe it's better if we cut it loose<br>
        <br>
        Tell me how your day was<br>
        No, I'm not okay<br>
        I don't know, I don't know, I don't know<br>
        I don't know, I don't know, I don't know<br>
        Time never moved so slow<br>
        Bed time, hit your phone up<br>
        Tell me where to go, where to go<br>
        Tell me where to go, where to go<br>
        <br>
        Too much time in the limelight<br>
        Gimme your all on the land line<br>
        Want it so bad but I won't lie<br>
        And it just gets worse in the night time<br>
        <br>
        Never stays for long<br>
        And she's gone in the morning<br>
        <br>
        When you come home<br>
        I just got over being less of you<br>
        When you leave me<br>
        I'm in pieces<br>
        Maybe it's better if we cut it loose<br>
        I don't know how to do this without you<br>
        I don't know, I don't know, I don't know<br>
        I don't know how to do this without you<br>
        I don't know, I don't know, I don't know<br>
        I don't know how to do this without you<br>
    </p>
