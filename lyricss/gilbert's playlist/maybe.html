    <p>
        Got no idea where I'm going, I'm lost <br>
        I guess it comes with having too much time <br>
        She's got her mind where her heart should be <br>
        And I use my heart where my mind is free <br>
        <br>
        And I, I don't wanna think about it<br>
        And I, I don't wanna think about it<br>
        'Cause I know how I feel and it's whole and it's real<br>
        But I don't know if I should still keep on going<br>

        'Cause I don't see the point in telling her I love her<br>
        When I know it goes one ear and out the other<br>
        She don't feel it the same way, well maybe, maybe as a friend<br>
        But even then I know I'm all alone, got no one in the end<br>
        <br>
        My imagination wanders off<br>
        Making up all kinds of scenes I know I'll never star in<br>
        And I'm wondering what keeps me tied down<br>
        I need some help pull me back to the ground<br>
        <br>
        And I, I don't wanna think about it<br>
        And I, I don't wanna think about it<br>
        'Cause I know how I feel and it's whole and it's real<br>
        But I don't know if I should still keep on going<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I don't see the point in telling her I love her<br>
        When I know it goes one ear and out the other<br>
        She don't feel it the same way, well maybe, maybe as a friend<br>
        But even then I know I'm all alone, got no one in the end<br>
        <br>
        Oh I don't know, oh I don't know<br>
        Oh, I don't see why I keep on going<br>
        I don't see the point in<br>
        Oh, I don't see the point in<br>
        Oh, I don't see the point in<br>
        <br>
        'Cause I don't see the point in telling her I love her<br>
        When I know it goes one ear and out the other<br>
        She don't feel it the same way, well maybe, maybe as a friend<br>
