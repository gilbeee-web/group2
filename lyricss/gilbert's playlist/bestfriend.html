    <p>
        I should've stayed at home<br>
        'Cause right now I see all these people that love me<br>
        But I still feel alone<br>
        Can't help but check my phone<br>
        I could've made you mine<br>
        But no, it wasn't meant to be and see, I wasn't made for you<br>
        And you weren't made for me<br>
        Though it seemed so easy<br>
        And that's because I wanna be your favorite boy<br>
        I wanna be the one that makes your day<br>
        The one you think about as you lie awake<br>
        I can't wait to be your number one<br>
        I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine<br>
        But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry<br>
        <br>
        But won't you wait?<br>
        You know it's too late<br>
        I'm on my own shit now<br>
        Let me tell you how it feels to be fucking great<br>
        I feel great<br>
        Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa<br>
        <br>
        You need to be yourself<br>
        Love someone for loving you instead of someone really cool<br>
        That makes your heart melt<br>
        Who knows what you truly felt?<br>
        You're still my favorite girl<br>
        You better trust me when I tell you<br>
        There ain't no one else more beautiful in this damn world<br>
        In this damn world<br>


        You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
        You're gonna wanna be my best friend<br>
        I said that<br>
        You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
        You're gonna wanna be my best friend, best friend<br>
        You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
        You're gonna wanna be my best friend<br>
        Best friend<br>
        You're gonna wanna be my best friend, baby<br>
        You're gonna wanna be my best friend<br>
        <br>
        I say that I'm happy<br>
        I say that I'm happy<br>
        But no, no, no, no<br>
        No, no, no<br>
        Oh, I still wanna be your favorite boy<br>
        I wanna be the one that makes your day<br>
        The one you think about as you lie awake<br>
        And I can't wait to be your number, your number one<br>
        I'll be your biggest fan and you'll be mine<br>
        But I still wanna break your heart and make you cry<br>
        I still wanna be your favorite boy<br>
        I wanna be the one<br>
        I might just be the one<br>
